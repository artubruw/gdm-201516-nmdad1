#Artuur Bruwier




##BIOGRAPHY


>Hi there! I am Artuur Bruwier. I live in Lendelede, West-Flanders, Belgium. Music is my biggest passion. I play drums in a band, I make electronic music and I listen to music all day long. Next to music, I'm also very obsessed by film. I like film, camera, acting and so on. If I wasn't studying Graphic and Digital Media here in Ghent, I'd probably be studying for 'Actor' in Maastricht.

##WORK EXPERIENCE


>I do not have any experience in this multimedial world. Therefore, I'm learning this. I want to get a better basis to start from and I want to learn things by myself too. However, I do have some small videoclips I shot in the past 4 years I guess.
As for webdesign I do not have any site up or I didn't work for some designers too. I only made 2 working websites for school last year.

##KNOWLEDGE WEBTECHNOLOGIES


I'm not that good with webtechnology. My interesest are not in this kind of things too. However, I realise that I will have to know these basics in this schoolprogram I follow. I already learned some <kbd>HTML and CSS</kbd>. Also <kbd>Javascript</kbd> and <kbd>j-Query</kbd> are languages which are not longer foreign to me. Anyway, I'm not a pro and I guess I will never be one too.
